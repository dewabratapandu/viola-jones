# Viola-Jones (Haar Cascade Classifiers)

You can train another dataset with this program. All you need to do is change the path of positive images and negative images in training.py and testing.py file.<br>
But it takes so many memories. If your image size is 24x24 and you have 8 GB RAM, then 1000 images are the maximum number of images you can train.
